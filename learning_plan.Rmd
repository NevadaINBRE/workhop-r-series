## Introduction to R pt. 1

This workshop serves as a gentle introduction to programming with R, with a focus on application to data science and research. R basics will be covered, such as using the command line as a calculator, storing values in a variable, basic data structures (vector, matrix, list, data frame, etc.), and data types. We will show how to load basic data sets and access rows/columns, and summarize data. We will also cover some considerations when choosing R over another language, and the differences between CRAN, GitHub, and Bioconductor packages.

## Introduction to R pt. 2

This workshop introduces scripting in R, including control flow, writing functions, installing/loading libraries, and file IO. We will go over the `-apply` family of functions (and maybe their `purrr` counterparts), simple graphs (with some ggplot2 examples), and good practices in R (style guide, organization, etc.)

**Materials**

- Computer with `R` and `RStudio` installed
- Internet connection (optional)

**Objectives**

Students will be able to:

- open up RStudio and identify key parts of the IDE
- create, open, and save R scripts
- run R scripts line by line or all at once
- write functions and understand when to use them
- use control flow to execute complex tasks
- install and load libraries
- understand the differences between CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub

## Reproducible Data Science

We will discuss the problems we commonly see and introduce what it means to conduct reproducible data science. During the workshop, we will go through an example of setting up a new project folder, loading "messy" data, organizing scripts, and creating basic Rmarkdown reports. In reference to the messy data, we will go over what "tidy" data is, and how to use `tidyr` and other `tidyverse` libraries.

## Tidy R

This will be a workshop fully devoted to data wrangling, including loading and cleaning "dirty" data, formatting "messy" data, and transforming "tidy" data to suit the task. There will be an emphasis on `tidyverse` libraries, but we will mention `data.table` as a faster alternative with fewer dependencies but with the trade-off of being less "readable".

## Producing Pretty Graphs and Tables with `base`, `ggplot2`, and `kable`

In this workshop, we will go over some principles of the visual display of quantitative data, and go in-depth with plotting in R with `base` and `ggplot2`. Additionally, since not all data is well represented in a graph, we will go over creating pretty tables using the `kable` and `kableExtra` packages.
